/* In react there's these things called life cycle methods. Now, essentially these are
 things that you can kind of hook into that allow you to alter the behavior of the 
 component. So the life cycle method that we're going to be using is called a 
 componentDidMount(). So componentDidMount() pretty much means that the component just
 rendered for the first time on the screen. There's a bunch of different lifecycle 
 methods. They're pretty much are just ways to hook into the behavior of this react 
 component. So if you want to do something before it loads or before it actually 
 renders on the screen, well then you would do that in a specific life cycle method.
 If you want to say, make the component not update. When something specific happens,
 then you would hook into the should component, update method or hook or whatever you
 want to call it and just say, Hey, no, we shouldn't update. */
